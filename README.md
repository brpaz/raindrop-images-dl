## üèπ Motivation

I am using Raindrop to archive Internet images like Gifs and Memes.

"Permanent Copy" helps to retain images that might be deleted, but there is no simple way to have a structure backup from this data in Raindrop.

Unfortunately the export feature of Raindrop is limited regarding images and uploaded files, so I built this tool to help with the backup process.


## üöÄ Getting started

### Pre-requisites

- A [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) account.
- A Raindrop API **Test token** - Check [here](https://developer.raindrop.io/v1/authentication/token)

### Install

This application is built as a single binary so the installation is very easy. Just heads up to the [Releases pages](https://github.com/brpaz/raindrop-images-dl/releases) and download the latest version for your Operating system.

You can also use Docker (and NixOS support is planned).

### Usage

Get the `collection id` of the Raindrop collection you want to download from. You can find it in the url, when accessing Raindrop Web App. Ex: `https://app.raindrop.io/my/<collection_id>`.

Then run the following command:

```shell
raindrop-images-dl download \
    -c=<my_collection_id>
    -k <raindrop_api_key>
    -o <path/to/images/dir>
```

Alternatively, envrionment variables can also be used instead of flags:

```shell
RAINDROP_API_KEY=<api_key> RAINDROP_COLLECTION=<collection_id> OUTPUT_DIR=<output> raindrop-images-dl download
```

The command will download the images found in your collection, to the output directory defined with `-o` option.

A subfolder with the collection name, will be created.

A `.info.json` file will be placed together with the image file. This file will save some Raindrop metadata like tags.

You can use this for doing some automations.
